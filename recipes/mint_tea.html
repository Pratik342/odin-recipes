        <p><em> "Fresh mint leaves give this mint tea recipe an alluring herbal aroma and flavor. Since this tea is made with an herb instead of tea leaves, it is considered an herbal tea or tisane and does not contain any caffeine. You can enjoy a cup of mint tea before bed without worries about it keeping you up.</em></p>

           <p><em>You can vary the mint in this recipe as long as it's fresh. Peppermint or spearmint are classic choices, but other varieties will work just as well. You can even use a mixture of them. While you can use dried mint for tea, it doesn't compare to the flavor of fresh herbs. Serve it hot or iced, sweetened or unsweetened, and with or without lemon. It's easy to adjust to your taste and customize to each drinker.</em></p> 
            
            <p><em>If you love mint tea but prefer a caffeinated beverage, Moroccan mint tea made with a blend of green tea ​(that has caffeine) and mint leaves might be just the ticket. For a summer quencher, consider an ​​iced tea recipe."</em></p>
