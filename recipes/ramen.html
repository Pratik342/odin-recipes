       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <p><ul><li> Instant Ramen Noodles</li>
       <li>Vegetables of your choice</li>
       <li>Water </li></ul></p>
       <h2>Directions</h2>
       <h4>1. BOIL THE WATER, ADD THE SEASONING PACKETS</h4>
       <p>Bring 2 ½ cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the soup base and vegetable mix. Boil for 1 minute.</p>
       <h4>2. DROP IN THE NOODLES—<em>GENTLY</em></h4>
       <p>Add the whole disc of dried noodles. Do not break the noodles in half. I know it’s fun to break stuff, but you must resist. Instead, slip the noodles into the boiling broth and press them down with chopsticks or a fork to keep them submerged. Don't stir the noodles—just keep them submerged. After 2 minutes, the noodles will soften and break apart.</p>
       <h4>3. FAN IT!</h4>
       <p>This is critical: I find that simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces a limp and soggy noodle. To avoid this, you have to slow down the noodle’s cooking process while the broth continues to cook. The best way to do this: fan the noodles.
